#### This app was created by me ([NoUpKeep](https://github.com/NoUpKeep/BinCollectionSchedule "NoUpKeep")) using [MIT App Inventor 2](https://appinventor.mit.edu/ "MIT App Inventor 2").

The reasoning being this was to create a useful app to allow residents of Cambridge City (the one in the UK) to keep track of what bin collection dates are coming up, and what bins are to be collected.

The app is self contained, does not collect any data about you, and does not record your location.
The source code (for want of a better word) is available.
**NOTE:** The source code can only be viewed using afor mentioned [MIT App Inventor 2](https://appinventor.mit.edu/ "MIT App Inventor 2")

I will (probably, maybe) update it at times.
